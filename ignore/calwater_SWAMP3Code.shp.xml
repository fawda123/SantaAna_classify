			<abstract>The California Interagency Watershed Map of 1999 (updated May 2004, "calw221") is the State of California's working definition of watershed boundaries.  Previous Calwater versions (1.2 and 2.2) described California watersheds, beginning with the division of the State's 101 million acres into ten Hydrologic Regions (HR).  Each HR is progressively subdivided into six smaller, nested levels: the Hydrologic Unit (HU, major rivers), Hydrologic Area (HA, major tributaries), Hydrologic Sub-Area (HSA), Super Planning Watershed (SPWS), and Planning Watershed (PWS).   At the Planning Watershed (the most detailed level), where implemented, polygons range in size from approximately 3,000 to 10,000 acres.  At all levels, a total of 7035 polygons represent the State's watersheds.  The present version, Calwater 2.2.1, refines the watershed coding structure and documentation (database fields were added and some were renamed).   There are significant watershed boundary, code, and name differences between Calwater versions 1.2 (1995), 2.0 (1998), and 2.2 (1999).  The differences between versions 2.2 (1999) and 2.2.1 (2004) are attribute field names and some inserted lines that identify differences between State and federal watersheds.

Calwater 2.2.1 most accurately delineates true watersheds in mountainous terrain.  However, neither Calwater 2.2.1 nor any of its predecessors is a "pure" watershed map because administrative boundaries such as the State border were used to delineate watershed areas.  Some of the boundaries, particularly in developed valley areas, also have legal and administrative purposes other than the representation of actual drainage divides.  Examples include the so-called "Legal Delta" (California Water Code, Chapter 2, the Delta, Sec. 12220) and other district boundaries.  Neither is Calwater a legal map document, as it does not represent State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) jurisdictions, officiated by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) under California Water Code Section 13200.  Calwater is a hybrid, a spatial cross-reference for use in local, State, and federal information communities.

The California Resources Agency (CRA) Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) contracted with Tierra Data Systems for the original digital production in 1993, based on Hydrologic Basin Planning Maps  published in hardcopy (SWRCB, 1986).  The State of California Stephen P. Teale Data Center GIS Solutions Group (Teale) under the direction of the California Department of Water Resrouces (DWR) and CDF, finalized the current version in ESRI ArcInfo coverage format in 1999 with USDA Forest Service and RWQCB/SWRCB inputs. The CRA California Spatial Information Library (CaSIL) is the current distributor of the coverage in the Teale Albers Conical Equal-Area projection, North American Datum of 1983. The California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) authored Calwater attribution design and documentation culminating in May 2004 with this Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC-STD-001-1998) standard metadata.</abstract>
			<purpose>The purpose of Calwater 2.2.1 is to standardize the boundary delineation, coding, and naming of California watersheds by government agencies.  Calwater also cross-references watershed codes implemented by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCB), as well as Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) published by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for California and the nation.

Standardized watershed delineations, codes, and names from both State and federal systems are used primarily to map, analyze, and document water resources and water quality information and regulations.  Examples include water quality reporting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by SWRCB and Timber Harvest Plan tracking by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF).   Applications also include regional planning, environmental analysis, hydrology, wildlands research, soils, agriculture, and fish and wildlife habitat management.  Calwater is also useful in geographic information systems (GIS) and for online data retrieval.  Calwater 2.2.1 and versions to follow are intended to provide a comprehensive geographic frame of reference for the California landscape.</purpose>
			<supplinf>This Supplemental Information explains State of California watershed coding, Calwater 2.2.1 designs and limitations, version history, processing, and attributes.  Users are advised to carefully review this material before implementing these watershed boundaries, names, or codes within their applications.

State Watershed Codes -- The Calwater Design

Calwater 2.2.1 is designed to divide the State into a series of six nested Levels of watersheds: Hydrologic Region, Hydrologic Unit, Hydrologic Area, Hydrologic Sub-Area, Super-Planning Watershed, and Planning Watershed (Table 1).  The principal objective is to uniquely identify (by name or code) all described watershed polygons.  As an evolving, integrated set of physical and administrative boundaries along with legacies of coding and naming, Calwater is not without its complexities and inconsistencies. Calwater's strengths are spatial accuracy and attribute versatility.

Note on Table 1: The Hydrologic Region is the
only Level fully subdivided into Hydrologic Units.
Other levels are partially subdivided and thus
computed counts of unique codes will vary.
The total of polygons at v2.2.1 is 7035,
the number of unique codes is 7008.
The total number of Hydrologic Unit names is 185.

Non-Unique Codes

There are several cases of replicated names and codes where 'watershed' designations are cartographically 'fragmented' into multiple polygons.  In these cases, each component polygon bears the same name and code (e.g. the Channel Islands chain, polygons 'split' by State and County borders, ground water basins, lake shorelines, etc).  The instances of valid, replicated codes are presented below (Table 2a).

Count = Number of watershed polygon fragments
RBU = R + B + U, where R = DWR HR numeric code,

Notes on Table 2a: 'Ground Water Line' refers to the delineation of Central Valley and Salinas Valley sediments that have historically defined divisions between valley and upland watersheds; 'Regional Splits' refer to watershed boundaries for County-related, administrative purposes; 'Federal HUC Splits' refer to a given State watershed overlapping a federal Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundary (in these cases, an 'artificial' line is inserted within the State watershed to enable accurate cross-references; other 'Splits' refer to the mapping artifact of having an otherwise whole watershed 'split' by State borders and other feature boundaries.

Watershed Sizes

In Calwater 2.2.1, all ten of California's Hydrologic Regions are subdivided into a total of 190 Hydrologic Units.  However, not all Hydrologic Units are subdivided into Hydrologic Areas, not all Hydrologic Areas are subdivided into Hydrologic Sub-Areas, nor are subdivisions complete at the Super-Planning and Planning Watershed levels.  This is most strongly evidenced in the watershed polygon sizes within a given Level.  For example, to track Timber Harvest Plan submissions, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) subdivided watersheds down to the Planning Watershed Level (PWS, code RBUASPW).  The PWS design criterion was a polygon size of approximately 3,000 to 10,000 acres. In areas of minimal timber harvest activity, however (the Central Valley, South Coast, and deserts) CDF did not subdivide watersheds, but an undivided polygon still bears a PWS code structure, if not the actual PWS sub-delineation. One example is in the deserts, the Amargosa River watershed, whose actual polygon size is 1.6 million acres.  As a general rule, a zero in the value for HA, HSA, SPWS, or PWS (unless it is a leading zero as in 01, 02, 03, etc) is an indication of the watershed being undivided at the subject Level, regardless of size.  Some PWS watersheds exhibit 'skipping' of upper Levels (SPWS, HSA, HA)  in their coding.

Watershed sizes also vary within the Hydrologic Unit (HU, code RBU) and other levels of the State and Regional Water Quality Control Board coding system.  In the 1970's and 80's, published HUs and HAs were much smaller (more precisely mapped) in the South Coast than they were in the North Coast.  Watershed size differences reflect, then as now, southern California population densities and associated water quality information requirements. For example, the Ventura Coastal Streams HU comprises 22,476 acres, whereas the Eel River HU (Humboldt, Mendocino Counties) encompasses over 2.6 million acres.

The representation of a given watershed may also be fragmented on the Calwater 2.2.1 map by the overlap of administrative boundaries.  Table 2b presents some examples where watershed total acreage is the sum of the areas of its component polygons.

Replicated Watershed Names

Calwater 2.2.1 also has several instances of replicated watershed names at various Levels, a legacy of State and Regional Water Quality Control Board maps (and an MOU by SWRCB, DWR and USGS in 1986).  Version 2.2 of Calwater released by the Stephen P. Teale Data Center (Teale) GIS Solutions Group in September, 1999 indicated this condition with entries of the form "SAME AS HUNAME", "SAME AS HANAME", etc in watershed name fields. This update (Calwater 2.2.1, May 2004) contains the original names as published by the SWRCB and RWQCBs.  In cases of replicated names, the watershed designation Level (HU, HA, etc) must be specified along with its name to avoid confusion (there is a known case of two HU code sets with the same HUNAME, SANTA ANA RIVER; see Logical Consistency Report).  Users are also advised to reference Calwater's unique watershed codes (with noted exceptions, Table 2).  The watershed code ulitmately provides the most reliable identification regardless of Level.

Cross-Referencing Challenges

Table 3 cross-references State of California Hydrologic Regions with federal Sub-Regions.  Within the State system, DWR and SWRCB/RWQCB designations differ in the Central Valley and South Coast. In the Central Valley, DWR codes three Hydrologic Regions (HRs 5, 6, and 7), whereas the SWRCB codes a single Regional Board (RB 5). In contrast, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board codes three Hydrologic Basin Planning Areas (HBPA: SB, SJ, and TL) that roughly correspond to the three DWR HRs (also note that SB and SR both refer to the Sacramento River Basin).  This situation is reversed in the South Coast: three Regional Boards are designated in DWR's one Hydrologic Region. Two other single-letter, historical codesets implemented in DWR Bulletin 130-85 "Hydrologic Data 1985" and in other DWR publications (Bulletins 118, 160, and 230) are listed for reference (but are not currently coded in Calwater 2.2.1).

Federal Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC)

In Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC), the federal system published by USGS (Water Supply Paper 2294, 1986), the nested hierarchy of watershed designations is generally similar to the State system.  Differences in use of the term "Hydrologic Region" reflect changes in scope from the national to the state level.  The federal HUC Hydrologic Region 18  (California) is defined as "...the drainage within the United States that ultimately discharges into the Pacific Ocean within the state of California; and (b) those parts of the Great Basin (or other closed basins) that discharge into the state of California. Includes parts of California, Nevada, and Oregon" (USGS, 1986, op.cit.).

At the State level, each of the ten California "Hydrologic Regions" roughly correspond to a HUC Sub-Region (Table 3).  The widely-known HUC designation is an 8-digit code now called the "SubBasin" (Huc_8), roughly equivalent to the State's Hydrologic Area (HA).  The SubBasin is also referred to as a "fourth field" watershed, where four 'fields' (2-digits each) progressively define watersheds from the Region (nationally) down to the SubBasin and smaller watersheds.  The term "SubBasin" term replaced the term "Cataloging Unit" (CU) in the emerging Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) standard (per FGDC Proposal, Version 1.0: "Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries"; Section 7.2.1, March 1, 2002); see also the Cross Reference section of this metadata).

At Calwater version 2.2.1, the "CU" field was renamed to "Huc_8" (FGDC / WBD, op.cit.).  Associated fields formerly named "CUNAME", "CU2", and "CU3" were changed to "HUC_8_NAME", "HUC_8_ALT2", and "HUC_8_ALT3", respectively.

State - Federal Watershed Code Cross-Reference

Calwater 2.2.1 provides polygon-by-polygon cross-references to federal Sub-Basin codes in its ArcInfo Polygon Attribute Table (.pat), described in the Entity Attribute section of this metadata.  Statewide, some 149 federal SubBasins map 1-to-1 with Calwater watersheds.  Only 18 Calwater watersheds overlap multiple SubBasins; 5 Calwater watersheds overlap three SubBasins.  An exception to the cross-reference design (the SubBasin listed in fields HUC_8 and HUC_8_NAME overlaps 80% or more of the State watershed) is the case of the SEAL_BEACH SubBasin. The majority overlap of the East Coastal Plain HSA is actually with the NEWPORT_BAY SubBasin (a third SubBasin, the SANTA_ANA, also has a minority overlap).  This exception enables all of the names of federal SubBasins in California to be contained in a single field "HUC_8_NAME".  Note that special 'patch' lines have been inserted into State watersheds to account for the major cases of federal HUC boundaries 'splitting' State watersheds, mostly in reservoir shorelines coded as 'watersheds' by SWRCB (see tables that itemize these cases).

Calwater Version History

Calwater version 2.2 is the third version of this dataset (after versions 1.2 and 2.0 and 2.1) and was based on 1:500,000-scale Hydrologic Basin Planning Maps published from 1973 through 1986 by the State Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento, California.

Version 1.2 was completed in 1995 by Tierra Data Systems, California, under contract to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF).  Linework was captured by overlaying SWRCB Hydrologic Basin Planning Area Maps on 1:24,000-scale, 7.5' USGS quads and then redrawing and digitizing lines to match watershed boundaries interpreted from elevation contours.  To the four existing SWRCB watershed levels: Hydrologic Regions (Level 1), Hydrologic Units (Level 2), Hydrologic Areas (Level 3), and Hydrologic Sub-Areas (Level 4), CDF created two additional levels to reference their Timber Harvest Plan tracking and other landscape analyses: the Super Planning Watershed (SPWS, Level 5) and the Planning Watersheds (PWS, Level 6).

In 1997, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) initiated adoption of only the first four Levels of Calwater 1.2 for maps associated with their California Water Plan updates of 1998.  In addition, DWR worked with the Stephen P. Teale Data Center (Teale) GIS Solutions Group to integrate so-called 'groundwater lines' which define the perimeters of the Central Valley and the Salinas Valley.  DWR and Teale also conducted extensive quality assurance on watershed delineation and coding, including inputs from the USDA Forest Service, principally the Klamath, Lassen, Mendocino, Shasta-Trinity, and Six Rivers National Forests.

The logical sequence for operational Calwater versions is 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1.  This is not an exact chronological sequence, as indicated above.  Calwater 2.0 is not in operational use, its main purpose now is the documentation of interagency consensus on 4 Levels of watershed coding, and on watershed boundaries, names, and codes statewide, except the Central Valley floor and selected lakes and reservoirs.  Calwater 2.1 represents the State Water Resources Control Board's Hydrological Basin Planning Maps, with boundaries, names, and codes as published in 1986, with modifications at the 1999 release of Calwater 2.2.  Calwater 2.2 (1999) represents the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) addition of watershed Levels 5 and 6 to the previously established 4-Level system of 1986 and 1998.  The present version, Calwater 2.2.1, modified version 2.2 with database field additions and field name changes, and was subjected to  documentation under FGDC-STD-001-1998.  There are no boundary, name, or code differences between Calwater versions 2.2 and 2.2.1 (except some 'patch' lines that identify federal HUC differences).

In 2001, the USDI Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) also worked with the Forest Service and USDI Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to develop hydrologically correct delineations (see Watershed Boundary Dataset, WBD, in Cross References) using Calwater 2.2 as one of several sources.

Interagency Cooperation

Following a State of California interagency Memorandum of Understanding "Regarding the Use and Maintenance of the California Watershed Map" (finalized by the signatory agencies listed below from 1998 to 2000], the USDI Bureau of Reclamation, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA Forest Service, U.S. Geological Survey and other federal agencies continued to work with staffs of National Forests, BLM, Counties, Resource Conservation Districts (RCD), Regional Water Boards, the State's Interagency Watershed Mapping Committee (IWMC), and other interested parties to revise California watershed boundaries for conformance to national standards.  Details on the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) are in the Cross References section of this metadata.

LIBRARY       : CA
LAYER NAME    : CALWATER22
COVERAGE NAME : CALW22A

COVERAGE DESCRIPTION:

The California Watershed Map (CALWATER version 2.2) is a set of
standardized watershed boundaries meeting standardized delineation
criteria.  The hierarchy of watershed designations consists of six
levels of increasing specificity: Hydrologic Region (HR),
Hydrologic Unit (HU), Hydrologic Area (HA), Hydrologic Sub-Area
(HSA), Super Planning Watershed (SPWS), and Planning Watershed
(PWS). The primary purpose of Calwater is the assignment of a
single, unique code to a specific watershed polygon.  While there
are 7022 polygons in the ARC/INFO coverage, there are actually
fewer watershed codes.  This is due to cases of multiple polygons
bearing the same watershed code (Channel Islands, split polygons
due to other boundary integration, e.g. ground water basins).
Another confusing factor is that not all Hydrologic Units are
subdivided into Hydrologic Areas, not all Hydrologic Areas are
subdivided into Hydrologic Sub-Areas, and so on.  Therefore, a
nominal count of watershed codes in Calwater 2.2 is:

Hydrologic Regions:           10
Hydrologic Units:            190
Hydrologic Areas:            522
Hydrologic Sub-Areas:        655
Super Planning Watersheds:  1623
Planning Watersheds:        6271

IDNUM TO HUC CROSSWALK

Calwater maps fairly neatly to the federal Hydrologic Unit Codes
(HUCS).  Generally Calwater watersheds fit within HUCs, though
there are some exceptions:

The IDNUM to HUC cross-reference was developed with the following
rules:

For a given [state] Calwater watershed, overlapping [federal]
Hydrologic Unit Codes (at the 8-digit Cataloging Unit [CU] level)
are listed up to a maximum of 80% of the Calwater watershed OR
three CUs, whichever comes first.

For example:

Where there are two CU codes (CU and CU2) listed for a given
Calwater code (only 18 [17] watersheds fit this criterion), the largest
CU alone overlaps less than 80% of the Calwater watershed, but
combining CU2 then provides overlap of at least 80% of the
Calwater watershed.

Where there are three CU codes (CU, CU2, and CU3) listed for a
given Calwater watershed (only 1 watershed fits this criterion,
[the East Coastal Plain HSA (Orange County), where
CU3 = 18070203, named SEAL_BEACH],
the largest 2 CUs together overlap less than 80% of the Calwater
watershed; combining a third CU code produces additional overlap.
Complete overlap statistics are left for calculation by the user.

If a watershed consists of multiple polygons (because it is split
by the groundwater line, the state boundary, or it is comprised of
multiple islands), the total area of the watershed (the sum of all
the polygons) is the value entered in the ACRES item
[in 2004 at Calwater version 2.2.1 (calw221) this was changed so that ACRES now contains only individual polygon acreages; this reduces risks of double counting areas].

The individual polygons of a multi-polygon watershed all have the same
watershed code.  These cases are itemized below:

LEGITIMATE DUPLICATE CODES (MULTIPLE POLYGONS FOR A SINGLE
WATERSHED):

Hydrologic Unit Level
Count  RBU              Condition
2         1102              Oregon Border Split
3         3316              Channel Islands Split
8         4406              Channel Islands Split
2         4481              LA/Santa Ana Regional Split [see notes above]
2         4845              LA/Santa Ana Regional Split
2         6542              Ground Water Line Split
...

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT:

The following are subjective comments regarding this data:

CALWATER boundaries were digitized on a 1:24,000-scale base and
thus very accurately divide surface water features depicted on
1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph hydrography.  However, CALWATER
delineations are primarily designed to be administrative reporting
units, and the boundaries should not be used to define
authoritative drainage area above a given point as a portion of
their definition includes non-physical boundaries, particularly in
valley floor and urbanized coastal regions. Attribute completeness
is good.  Compatibility with existing state and federal watershed
delineations is good, except where explicitly different boundary
configurations are applied.

Calwater Status

On July 1, 2001 custodial responsibility for Calwater 2.2 was transferred, upon closure of Teale GIS Solutions Group operations, to the California Resources Agency in Sacramento.  Efforts are underway as of 2004 to also host Calwater at a node of the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) at the University of California Davis Information Center for the Environment (UCD / ICE).  The current version is called Calwater 2.2.1 ("calw221") and is dated May 2004.  The California Resources Agency's California Spatial Information Library (CaSIL) is the current distributor of Calwater.</supplinf>

Appendix H contains 2 components
1. "Hydrologic Basin Codes": a printout for each [Hydrologic] Region showing current watershed names and the State Board [Code], DWR [Areal Code], and USGS [8-digit HUC] codes.

["...In 1978 the State Water Resources Control Board, the California Department of Resources, and the U.S. Geological Survey agreed on revised boundaries and names for watersheds in the State.  Each Agency retained its own coding system.  The State Board and DWR agreed on a common watershed hierarchical nomenclature of Hydrologic Basins (HB), Units (HU), Areas (HA) and Subareas (HSA), dropping the old term "Subunit" (SU)..."

[see previous 1976 SWRCB / DWR Operating Understanding for California watershed designations]

2. "Modified Hydrologic Basins": a printout for each Region showing only those watersheds which have had a name, code, and/or boundary update [at 1986 revision of SWRCB Hydrologic Basin Planning Area maps].

			<attraccr>Calwater contains unique codes and names for over 99% of the 7035 watershed polygons described (exceptions are detailed in Supplemental Information and in the Logical Consistency and Completeness Reports in this metadata).  A quantitative analysis of conformance to federal watershed delineation standards is in progress.

The field ACRES (numeric figure, zero decimal places) is provided for only general comparison of watershed sizes; no accuracy assesment has been performed.  Note that in reprojecting Calwater 2.2 from the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) to NAD 83, some minor changes in acreages were obtained.  All acreage changes measure less than one tenth of one percent, with the observed maximum difference being 44 acres in the 1.6 million-acre Stove Pipe Wells HSA (SWRCBNUM21 = 609.11).</attraccr>

		<logic>Calwater 2.2.1 Logical Consistency Report

The logical consistency of Calwater 2.2.1 (May 2004 Update, "calw221") was examined by reviewing watershed coding at various levels and by comparison to previously-published watershed maps.

Calwater 2.2.1 boundaries were digitized on a 1:24,000-scale USGS topographic map base and thus accurately divide surface water features depicted at that scale as well as on 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph hydrography.  However, Calwater 2.2.1 delineations are primarily designed to be administrative reporting units, and the boundaries should not be used to define authoritative drainage area above a given point as a portion of their definition includes non-physical boundaries, particularly in valley floor and urbanized coastal regions. Attribute completeness is good.  Compatibility with existing state and federal watershed delineations is good, except where explicitly different boundary configurations are applied.

Calwater 2.2.1 is designed to uniquely identify each watershed polygon.  There are, however, several cases where multiple polygons bearing replicates of the same watershed code (e.g. Channel Islands, split polygons due to other boundary integration, such as ground water basin boundaries, State boundaries, etc).  The approximate number of actual watershed designations by level (Table 1) and the instances of valid, duplicated codes (Tables 2a and 2b) are presented below.  Table 3 provides State - Federal cross-references of watershed codes and names.

In Calwater 2.2.1, all ten of California's Hydrologic Regions are subdivided into a total of 190 Hydrologic Units (there are actually only 185 Hydrologic Unit names because five polygons in RBU 4481 have the same HUNAME (SANTA ANA RIVER) as 42 polygons in RBU 4801 due to a County-line split of the actual watershed polygons).  However, not all Hydrologic Units are subdivided into Hydrologic Areas, not all Hydrologic Areas are subdivided into Hydrologic Sub-Areas, nor are subdivisions complete at the Super-Planning and Planning Watershed levels.  This is most strongly evidenced in the watershed polygon sizes within a given level.  For example, to track Timber Harvest Plan submissions, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) subdivided watersheds down to the Planning Watershed  level (PWS, code RBUASPW).  The PWS was designed around a polygon size of approximately 3,000 to 10,000 acres. In areas of minimal timber harvest activity (Central Valley, South Coast, and Deserts) CDF did not subdivide watersheds, leaving some individual polygons totalling as much as 1.6 million acres.  Where watersheds are undivided, "undefined" is entered in the watershed name fields for appropriate levels.

There are also cases where Calwater version 2.2 has watersheds subdivided to Level 5 and 6 in larger, previously undivided watersheds (at Levels 2 and 3) on the SWRCB maps of 1986.  In other words,  'Level-skipping' has occurred in the process of defining the most detailed level of watersheds (at Level 6, the 'Planning Watershed', PWS).  This has significance for pre-Calwater users of watershed coding at DWR and SWRCB because, if the 4-Level coding schema is followed, there are several instances where 'undefined' will apply to not only the PWS, but also to higher Levels: the Hydrologic Area (HA, Level 3) and Hydrologic Sub-Area (HSA, Level 4).

Watershed sizes also vary within the Hydrologic Unit (HU, code RBU) and other levels of the State and Regional Water Quality Control Board coding system.  In the 1970's and 80's, published HUs and HAs were much smaller (more precisely mapped) in the South Coast than they were in the North Coast.  Watershed size differences reflect, then as now, southern California population densities and associated water quality information requirements. For example, the Ventura Coastal Streams HU comprises 22,476 acres, whereas the Eel River HU (Humboldt, Mendocino Counties) encompasses over 2.6 million acres.

Calwater 2.2.1 also has several instances of duplicated watershed names at various Levels, a legacy of State and Regional Water Quality Control Board maps (and an MOU with DWR and USGS in 1986).  Users are advised to reference  unique watershed codes (with noted exceptions, Table 2) as these are the most reliable identifiers at all watershed levels.

Within the State system, DWR and SWRCB/RWQCB designations differ in the Central Valley and South Coast. In the Central Valley, DWR codes three Hydrologic Regions (HRs 5, 6, and 7); SWRCB codes 1 Regional Board (RB 5). In contrast, within the same Central Valley, the Regional and State Water Boards code three Hydrologic Basin Planning Areas (HBPA) that roughly correspond to the three DWR HRs.  Conversely, the State Board recognizes three Regional Boards in DWR's South Coast HR. Note that the two-letter acronyms SR and SB both refer to the Sacramento River basin

Note on Table 1: The Hydrologic Region is the
only Level fully subdivided into Hydrologic Units.
Other levels are partially subdivided and thus
computed counts of unique codes will vary.
The total of polygons at v2.2 is 7022,
the number of unique codes is 7008.
The total number of Hydrologic Unit names is 185.

State - Federal Watershed Code Cross-Reference

Calwater 2.2.1 provides polygon-by-polygon cross-references to federal Sub-Basin codes in its ArcInfo Polygon Attribute Table (.pat), described in the Entity Attribute section of this metadata.  Statewide, some 149 federal SubBasins map 1-to-1 with Calwater watersheds.  Only 18 Calwater watersheds overlap multiple SubBasins; 5 Calwater watersheds overlap three SubBasins.  An exception to the cross-reference design (the SubBasin listed in fields HUC_8 and HUC_8_NAME overlaps 80% or more of the State watershed) is the case of the SEAL_BEACH SubBasin. The majority overlap of the East Coastal Plain HSA is actually with the NEWPORT_BAY SubBasin (a third SubBasin, the SANTA_ANA, also has a minority overlap).  This exception enables all of the names of federal SubBasins in California to be contained in a single field "HUC_8_NAME".  Note that special 'patch' lines have been inserted into State watersheds to account for the major cases of federal HUC boundaries 'splitting' State watersheds, mostly in reservoir shorelines coded as 'watersheds' by SWRCB (see tables that itemize these cases).

Table 4:
Calwater 2.0 (DWR) and Calwater 2.2 (CDF, SWRCB) Coding Differences
at the Hydrologic Sub-Area (HSA) Watershed Level (Level 4).

Key:
Cdfgnum22 = California Department of Forestry (CDF) watershed ID at Calwater version 2.2 (1999).

Swrcbnum21, Hsaname = California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) watershed ID and name as published on
Hydrologic Basin Planning Area Maps (revised 1986, with exceptions noted in Completeness Report)

Dwrnum20, Dwrhsaname = California Department of Water Resources (DWR) alternate watershed ID and name at Calwater version
2.0 (1998)

"undefined" = Cases where watersheds designated in levels above the HSA (HU, HA) were not subdivided;
this occurs in 89 of 116 total cases of code differences between SWRCB (Calwater 2.1) and DWR (Calwater 2.0, 1998).

Notes on Table 4:
0. Swrcbnum21 (aka 'hydrologic basin code', 'hsa number', etc) is SWRCB's index to USEPA water quality reporting.
1. The listed Cdfnum22 codes contain a prefix of 1 digit and a suffix of 4 digits to Swrcbnum21 codes
   to account for Hydrologic Region and Regional Water Board coding differences and to account for
   subdivision of watersheds at Level 4 (HSA) into Levels 5 and 6 (SPWS and PWS).
2. DWR does not generally recognize lake or reservoir shorelines as 'watershed' units in SWRCB coding
3. Several SWRCB codes in the Central Valley were changed by DWR under the above MOU at Calwater version 2.0
   and reinserted by SWRCB at version 2.1.
4. Some codes were added to the 1986 SWRCB set by CDF and DWR during the production of Calwater 2.2
5. The majority of code differences occur in the Central Valley floor (SWRCB's 500-series coding).
6. DWR-alternate names for watersheds at the Hydrologic Unit (HU) and Hydrologic Area (HA) Level are not shown here.
   At the HU Level, DWR effected 6 HU name changes to the existing set of 31 SWRCB HU names.
   At the HA Level, differences between SWRCB and DWR names involve either a DWR name entry for an undefined SWRCB watershed
   or a change of an existing SWRCB HA name.  All coding and naming is in the Calwater 2.2.1 polygon attribute table
   "calw221.pat".

See:
Operating Understanding Between the State Water Resources Control Board
and the Department of Water Resources Regarding Basin Planning Boundaries (1976)

		<complete>State Watershed Coding

All watershed polygons defined by Calwater 2.2.1 within the State of California boundary are named and coded.  Portions of watersheds physically extending beyond the State boundary are not mapped by Calwater 2.2.1 and are explicity depicted as such on the map.

In Calwater 2.2.1 all ten of the State of California's Hydrologic Regions are completely subdivided into a total of 190 Hydrologic Units (there are only 185 Hydrologic Unit names - see Logical Consistency Report).  However, not all Hydrologic Units are subdivided into Hydrologic Areas, not all Hydrologic Areas are subdivided into Hydrologic Sub-Areas, nor are subdivisions complete for the entire State at the Super-Planning and Planning Watershed levels.  Some PWS watersheds (Level 6) exhibit 'skipping' of upper Levels in their coding.  Completeness of coding at the Hydrologic Unit (HU) Level is described in detail below.

Completeness Report on Calwater 2.2.1
State of California Hydrologic Unit (HU) Coding

Summary:
Total Cases: 20
Descriptive categories:

1) HUs not divided into Hydrologic Areas (HA) nor Hydrologic Sub-Areas (HSA)
by SWRCB on Hydrologic Basin Planning Area (HBPA) Maps.

2) Undivided HUs from (1) later subdivided by CDF and/or DWR at Super-Planning Watershed (SPWS) or Planning Watershed (PWS)
Levels (5 and 6, respectively). For this item and (1) above,
the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) entered "undefined" as value in appropriate name fields.

3) Boundary, name, and code modifications after 1986 revision of HBPA Maps.

4) New name and/or code introductions by CDF and/or DWR into SWRCB codeset at Calwater version 2.2

Confirmation with local Regional Water Quality Control Board staff is recommended for all cases.

end Completeness Report on Calwater 2.2.1 Hydrologic Unit (HU) coding
by pveisze@dfg.ca.gov 20040505

Note: completeness of coding at the Hydrologic Area (HA) and Hydrologic Sub-Area (HSA) is not provided at this version of the metadata, but would be similar in characteristics to the HU Cases described above.

Federal Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC)

All of the federal Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) intersected by Calwater 2.2.1 designations are cross referenced.  However, not all HUC SubBasins (Huc_8, formerly known as Cataloging Unit (CU)) ascribed to federal Hydrologic Region 18 (California) have a majority of their area within the State boundary.  For example, in the upper Klamath River Basin, SubBasins 18010201, 18010202, and 18010203 fall entirely within the State of Oregon.  Other SubBasins in HUC Hydrologic Regions 15, 16, and 17 (portions of Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon, respectively) also have partial overlap within California (see Supplemental Information, Table 3).

SubBasin 18070203 (SEAL_BEACH) constitutes the only exception to the rule of listing the majority overlap (80%) of a SubBasin with a Calwater watershed (in the field "HUC_8").  The actual majority overlap of the East Coastal Plain (SWRCBNUM22 = 801.11) is with the NEWPORT_BAY (SubBasin 18070204). This exception enables all other instances of names of California SubBasins to be contained in a single field "HUC_8_NAME".  Fields "HUC_8_ALT2" and "HUC_8_ALT3" indicate minority overlap SubBasins and provide only the numeric SubBasin code.</complete>

				<procdesc>Calwater version 1.2 was completed in 1995 by Tierra Data Systems, California, under contract to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF).  Linework was captured by overlaying SWRCB Hydrologic Basin Planning Area Maps on 1:24,000-scale, 7.5' USGS quads and then redrawing and digitizing lines
to match watershed boundaries interpreted from elevation contours.  To the four existing SWRCB watershed levels: Hydrologic Regions (Level 1), Hydrologic Units (Level 2), Hydrologic Areas (Level 3), and Hydrologic Sub-Areas (Level 4), CDF created two additional levels to reference their Timber Harvest Plan tracking and other landscape analyses: the Super Planning Watershed (SPWS, Level 5) and the Planning Watersheds (PWS, Level 6).</procdesc>

In addition, DWR worked with the Stephen P. Teale Data Center (Teale) GIS Solutions Group to integrate so-called 'groundwater lines' which define the perimeters of the Central Valley and the Salinas Valley.  DWR and Teale also conducted extensive quality assurance on watershed delineation and coding.  CDF and DWR also worked with Teale to revise Calwater with inputs from the USDA Forest Service, principally the Klamath, Lassen, Mendocino, Shasta-Trinity, and Six Rivers National Forests.

Throughout the integration of various linework sources, Teale, DWR, and DFG performed checks of watershed delineation accuracy (against USGS quads and USGS Digital Elevation Models).  Code and watershed name uniqueness was checked by frequency tabulation.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Calwater 2.2 - to - HUC Crosswalk (State - Federal Hydrologic Code Cross Reference)

The cross-reference of State of California watershed codes in Calwater 2.2 to federal Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) was developed with the following rules:

For a given [state] Calwater watershed, overlapping [federal] Hydrologic Unit Codes (at the 8-digit SubBasin (formerly Cataloging Unit [CU] level) are listed up to a maximum of 80% of the Calwater watershed OR three SubBasins, whichever comes first.

For example:

Where there are two SubBasin codes (HUC_8_ALT2, HUC_8_ALT3) listed for a given Calwater code (only 17 watersheds fit this criterion), the largest overlapping SubBasin alone constitutes less than 80% of the Calwater watershed, but combining a second SubBasin then provides overlap of at least 80% of the Calwater watershed.

Where there are three SubBasin codes listed for a given Calwater watershed (only 1 watershed fits this criterion, the East Coastal Plain, SWRCBNUM21 =  801.11, Orange County),  The largest 2 SubBasins together overlap less than 80% of the Calwater watershed; combining a third SubBasin code produces additional overlap.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Calwater 2.2.1  Process Step Summary
(May 28, 2004 Update, "calw221")
1. Datum conversion: NAD 27 to NAD 83 (Teale Albers Conical Equal-Area Projection)
2. Watershed Name Fields Re-computation; values adjusted
3. ACRES Field Re-computation after re-projection
4. Dataset Identifier changed to "calw221"
5. Added 2 new fields, renamed 9 existing fields
6. Renamed federal HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) cross-reference fields in conformance with Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) (values unchanged).
7. Corrected 1 HUC name ommission and renamed 1 CDFPWSNAME.
8. Added linework to facilitate dissolve to federal SubBasins on field HUC_8
9. Spelling corrections on HUNAME
----
1. Datum conversion: ArcInfo coverage calw22 (also known as CALW22A) was reprojected from its original datum / projection to the Teale Albers Conical Equal-Area projection, North American Datum of 83 (NAD 83).  The ArcInfo PROJECT command was used with parameters appended below.  Polygon attribute table fields "AREA" and "PERIMETER" were automatically updated after the BUILD command.

2. Watershed Name Fields: There are several known instances of replicated watershed names at various Levels in the Calwater coding system, a legacy of State and Regional Water Quality Control Board maps (see SWRCB MOU with DWR and USGS in 1986).  The version of Calwater 2.2 originally released by the Teale GIS Solutions Group (September 1999) indicated this condition with entries of the form "SAME AS HUNAME", "SAME AS HANAME", etc in watershed name fields.  This was problematic for users dissolving polygon boundaries at various Levels.  In this 2004 version "calw221" watershed names as published by SWRCB were restored to their appropriate fields.  A name value of "undefined" was entered where a given watershed polygon was not divided at a particular level.  Users are advised to rely on watershed codes rather than names (with noted exceptions, see Logical Consistency Report) as the most consistent, unique watershed identifiers at all levels.

3. ACRES Field: The polygon attribute table field "ACRES" was manually re-computed after reprojection.  There are cases where watersheds polygons are fragmented by State, County and other boundaries.  Watershed acreage totals originally replicated in each of a watershed's component polygon records were replaced by values specific to the individual polygons.  This avoids the risk of double-counting when summing watershed areas.

4. Dataset identifier: After the above steps, the output coverage was renamed from "calw22" to "calw221".

5. Added 2 new fields, renamed 9 existing fields:

a. Create new field "CALWNUM";
Explanation: This field is the primary key for Calwater 2.2.1; legacy coding from Calwater 2.2 is preserved in field "CDFNUM22";
The CALWNUM field will contain coding changes at future versions.

a.2. Create new field "SWRCBNUM21"
Explanation: This field matches the watershed codes published in the State Water Resources Control Board's
Hydrologic Basin Planning Area maps (12 maps in the series, last revised 1986), with some exceptions as noted in
Completeness Report of this metadata.  Identifies SWRCB as originator of the codes (excluding exceptions)
at Calwater version 2.2.

b. Copy IDNUM to CALWNUM;
This action preserved coding from Calwater version 2.2.

c. Rename IDNUM to CDFNUM22;
Identifies CDF as the originator of the codes at Calwater version 2.2.

d. Create new field "DWRNUM20";
Identifies DWR as the originator of the codes at Calwater version 2.0.
Note: DWRNUM20 coding is incomplete for differentiation of some DWR-named watersheds at the HA and HSA levels.

e. Copy IDNUM_20 to DWRNUM20;
This action preserved DWR coding from Calwater version 2.0.

f. Select DWRNUM20 = null; Calculate DWRNUM20 = CALWNUM;
Explanation: DWR watershed identifiers differ from those of SWRCB; where different, the values are preserved;
where the DWR and SWRCB agree on the values, the field values are now actually equal.  See Calwater MOU of 1998.

g. Rename HUNAME_20 to DWRHUNAME
Explanation: This field has a new name to identify the data source

h. Rename HANAME_20 to DWRHANAME;
Explanation: This field has a new name to identify the data source

i. Rename HSANAME_20 to DWRHSANAME;
Explanation: This field has a new name to identify the data source

j. Rename SPWSNAME to CDFSPWNAME;
Explanation: This field has a new name to identify the data source

k. Rename PWSNAME to CDFPWSNAME;
Explanation: This field has a new name to identify the data source

6. Renamed federal HUC fields: At Calwater version 2.2.1, the "CU" field (formerly representing the Cataloging Unit level of HUC, was renamed to "Huc_8", now representing the "SubBasin" level, per FGDC Proposal, Version 1.0: "Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries" (Section 7.2.1, March 1, 2002).  Associated fields formerly named "CUNAME", "CU2", and "CU3" were changed to "HUC_8_NAME", "HUC_8_ALT2", and "HUC_8_ALT3", respectively.  See Cross-Reference Section of this metadata.

7. Corrected  HUC_8 name ommission "SEAL BEACH"; added CDFPWSNAME "Sterling Mountain".

8. Added linework to facilitate dissolve to federal SubBasins on field HUC_8 or HUC_8_NAME:
a.) 5/25/2004: Downloaded federal watershed boundaries from ftp://water.usgs.gov/pub/dsdl/huc250.e00.gz
b.) 5/27/2004: Using ArcInfo / ArcEdit / EditFeature Poly, selected major cases of State watershed polygons that overlapped multiple federal SubBasins (mostly reservoir outlines).
c.) Issued the ArcEdit SPLIT command for each selected case, and screen-digitized a line following associated USGS "huc250" (see Cross References) boundary.
d.) In the Arc Attribute Table, calculated item LEVEL = 0 for each added 'split' line.
e.) Edited the HUC_8 and HUC_8_NAME polygon attributes to identify each federal SubBasin overlapping the subject State watershed
f.) Recomputed the ACRES field on each polygon resulting from SPLIT command (using the ArcView 3.3-bundled script "View.CalculateAcreage" (calcacre.ave))
g.) 5/27/04: issued final BUILD commands with POLY and LINE options.

9. Spelling corrections on HUNAME:
a.) Removed extra blank in "SANTA MARIA" value for HUNAME which was causing improper sort order
b.) Corrected spelling from "BOLSA NEUVA" to "BOLSA NUEVA".</procdesc>

		<overview>
			<eaover>Codes and names are unique for each watershed polygon (except where noted in Supplemental Information and in Logical Consistency Report).  Polygon attributes indicate varying levels in the State watershed hierarchy (RBU, RBUA, etc) and are provided for users to dissolve polygon boundaries to the desired level.  Cross-references to federal watershed codes and names are also provided. The "LEVEL" attribute in the arc attribute table may also be used with graduated line weights to cartographically represent the hierarchy of watershed designations.</eaover>
